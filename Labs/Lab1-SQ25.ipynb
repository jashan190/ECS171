    "Lab1: Complete the TODO parts in the following code. \n",
    "- Using California Housing Dataset from sklearn, select input attributes 1,3,4  as the input features. \n",
    "- Using K-fold cross validation technique (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html), complete the implementation to train a regression model and report performance merics when asked in the following code. \n",
    "- For multiple degrees of model complexity (i.e., degree of polynomial in this exercise) in a for-loop, obtain the model with the minimum reducible_error, polynomial degree, and run the obtained model on the test data. For this part,you should use the split the data into train and test by [75:25] rate and report mse of the final model on test data. \n",
    "- Analyse the results of model performance according to different degrees of polynomial and the number of folds used. You can manipulate the code and share your analysis in terms of the performance of the model (mse and total error), such as for instnace which degree of the model complexity (in relation to the polynomial order) would give a better model? Feel free to include other analysis about the generated models in relation to their performance results. You can event plot the results to support your analysis. "

    "As we increase the degree of the polynomial, we start to see the usual tradeoff between bias and variance. When the model is too simple—like with degree 1 or 2—it tends to miss important patterns, showing higher bias and underfitting the data. On the flip side, higher-degree models (like degree 4 or 5) do a better job capturing the training data, which lowers bias, but they also become more sensitive to noise, leading to higher variance and a risk of overfitting.\n",

    "Degree 3 strikes a good balance. It keeps the total error stable and gives a relatively low mean squared error (MSE), making it a solid choice. While degree 5 does produce the lowest test MSE overall, its performance is less consistent across different data splits, which suggests it might not generalize as well.\n",
